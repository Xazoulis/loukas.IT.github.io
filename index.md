## About Me

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology at Southern New Hampshire University, with an expected graduation in 2026. Since 2019, I’ve been working as an associate at Amazon, where I’ve developed a strong sense of responsibility, teamwork, and attention to detail in a fast-paced, technology-driven environment.

Outside of work, I’ve always had a deep interest in computers and emerging technologies. Between 2019 and 2022, I built and maintained my own Ethereum mining rigs, gaining hands-on experience in hardware setup, GPU optimization, and system troubleshooting — long before Ethereum transitioned away from proof-of-work.

My passion for technology continues to grow, and my goal is to build a long-term career in the IT field where I can apply my skills, solve real-world problems, and stay on the cutting edge of tech innovation.
